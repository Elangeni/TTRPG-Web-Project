    We haven't been bonding with DnD for a while and I was
    thinking about ways we can spend time together. I think it's pretty cool
    that you want tearn how to code and I was pretty excited whe were we
    speaking of different projects to work on
    together. Last time I was there we talked about our first project being a
    "wiki" of sorts for a bunch of different TTRPGs. You now know the basics of
     HTML and are learning CSS so I figured we could start! At least we might
     find some cool games we
    could play together.
